# MPS with metal

This app demonstrates an implemetation of [using Matrix Product States for machine learning](https://github.com/TrMPS/MPS-MNIST) running on the GPU on an iOS device using the Metal framework. The UI is almost entirely from [iOS-CoreML-MNIST](https://github.com/r4ghu/iOS-CoreML-MNIST). Note: MPS here refers to Matrix Product States, not Metal Performance Shaders.
